    "description": "here is a clear distinction between the Web, as it is now experienced on mobile devices, and native mobile experiences, such as the ones users get when navigating through applications downloaded from the AppStore (iOS) or the GooglePlay platform (Android), and accessibility is no exception.  This training is intended for participants who have already successfully completed Deque’s 2-day Bootcamp and will provide an overview of considerations specific to the native mobile environment, both for iOS and Android, so your team can successfully create accessible experiences on mobile applications beyond the Web.  Deque’s modular training approach allows for both half-day or up to 2 full days of extended training in this topic area, with a mix of lectures and hands-on workshop exercises designed to empower your cross-functional team to make informed and accessible decisions",
