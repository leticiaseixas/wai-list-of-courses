The training will also introduce ways through which the many responsibilities pertinent to Web accessibility can be distributed by roles, so each member of your team understands the role they should play when it comes to successfully integrating accessibility in the project development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThis training is intended for all audiences, including policy makers and other “non-web” attendees (a.k.a. Management).",
